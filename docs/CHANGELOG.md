# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Show task status, paged Cindy replies and transcription review on Passport; UP re-records, DOWN reads, and OK confirms sending to the original task through Cindy’s selected voice-input service.

- Reduce the LVGL pool to 32 KB after measuring the Chinese task and recording pages, leaving contiguous heap for Opus initialization on ESP32-C3.

- Keep the stored bond when link encryption fails or times out, and drop it only for an encrypted but unauthenticated just-works link, so one failed reconnection no longer leaves the Mac holding pairing material the device has discarded. Log BLE connect, disconnect and security state.

- Keep the Bluetooth link and the last received task list after the Tasks page closes, so leaving and re-entering the page no longer drops the pairing or empties the list.

- Use 40 ms Opus frames with variable payload lengths for BLE voice feedback. The shorter encoder frame reduces the ESP32-C3 recording stack peak while the client keeps complete Ogg timing and bounded packet counts.

- Render task text with a Flash-resident Noto CJK font and preserve UTF-8 truncation boundaries. Size the LVGL pool for the eight-card task view. Start bounded Opus recording within the ESP32-C3 heap budget and send it over authenticated BLE indications to the matching Cindy transcription adapter. Completed-task retention is provided by the desktop adapter.

- Add an opt-in Cindy BLE task mode with authenticated passkey pairing, atomic bounded snapshots, waiting-state color, stale-state clearing and task-ID button actions. Requires the matching macOS Cindy adapter.

- Rework Cindy task cards and details to separate titles, status and bounded scrolling messages; keep navigation and bridge-file provenance visible, and show the target task while recording. Preserve the pixel theme and existing button controls.

- Use Wi-Fi performance mode only during recording and restore the previous mode on exit; disable TCP small-packet coalescing for PCM uploads and log transmitted bytes and maximum write time.

- Fixed false recording queue timeouts during buffered microphone bursts by allowing a bounded 20 ms wait for the uploader; added controller regressions and explicit task-source/upload-interruption logs.

- Replaced whole-recording RAM allocation with bounded PCM streaming (30-second limit); reject incomplete uploads and report recording memory/transport failures. Update the local bridge together with the firmware.

- Fixed Cindy Tasks station/DHCP ownership, connection diagnostics, page shutdown, recording stop/send, list scrolling and detail refresh; added station lifecycle regression tests.

- Added the Cindy task bridge demo: a Tasks menu page with Wi-Fi STA connection (credentials in a gitignored main/app_config.h), 3-second polling of a local bridge server for up to 8 tasks with status chips and latest-message previews, a task detail view, and hold-to-record 16 kHz mono PCM feedback submitted over HTTP; added the dependency-free bridge/server.py that serves tasks.json and archives recordings as WAV files, plus host tests for the task list model.
- Added the supplied 80-byte CW2017 profile for the specified 520 mAh cell, including content/update-flag checks, verified writes, the required restart sequence, and bounded SOC-readiness polling.

- Expanded the environment bootstrap document: added Espressif's Git service mirror (`git.espressif.com.cn`) as the preferred mainland-China route for ESP-IDF v5.5.3 and its submodules, documented submodule long-wait/timeout handling, in-place repair, and the pinned-commit shallow fetch for large submodules such as `esp32-wifi-lib`, warned about stale per-repository Jihulab `insteadOf` residue, and added the official offline release archive as a last-resort fallback (learned from `esp-mosaico/esp-mosaico-vibe`).

- Reorganized the documentation by function area with a dual entry point: the root `AGENTS.md` is now a thin router (hard constraints + task routing only) and the detailed AI workflow lives in `docs/development/ai-guide.md`; `agent-guide.md` was folded in. `docs/development/` gained a second level (`engineering/`, `ci/`, `release/`), and the `plays/` application archive and `experiences/` moved into a `docs/reference/` area with a dedicated README. Removed `docs/software-design/` (empty scaffold); folded the three `assets/{fonts,images,music}/README` leaves into the `assets/` README; flattened the six `project-completion` sub-documents into a single file; and unified each directory to a single README, eliminating every `INDEX` file and a duplicated experience index. All cross-references and bibliographic links were updated; no content was dropped.

- Removed the obsolete app/test partition at `0x700000` and its related
  bootloader, validation, and documentation requirements. The fixed protected
  `cardid` partition and its CI checks remain unchanged.
- Documented a release-title convention for multi-app releases: name tags as `v<version>-<app-name>` (e.g. `v0.1.0-voice-keychain`) so the release title carries the version and the app, and confirm the title after the release is published so a release list is scannable by app.
- Added a post-release follow-up workflow: an `issue-suggestions` skill for filing user feedback as issues against the upstream project, an `experience-pr` skill for submitting reusable development experience as a documentation PR, a `docs/experiences/` directory for per-entry experience files, and supporting `project-completion`, `file-issues`, and experience-index documents.
- Simplified the tracked repository root: moved GitHub-recognized community documents into `.github/`, moved the changelog into `docs/`, updated every reference, and added a root-document allowlist to repository checks.
- Repository-wide language policy: every maintained Markdown default `.md` file is English, Simplified Chinese uses a paired `.zh_CN.md`, and both provide language switches. Static checks reject missing peers, missing switches, and Chinese prose in English defaults.
- Phase one of the AI development workflow: streamlined task-based context routing, unified local/CI validation, added PR checks and a template, and committed the dependency lock for reproducible builds.
- PR review fixes: pinned GitHub Actions to full commit SHAs, split build/release jobs by least privilege, disabled persisted sync checkout credentials, added Feature Request and Usage Question forms, clarified private security-report fallback, and corrected stale README, CI-trigger, and branch descriptions.
- Changed commit titles, PR titles, and PR bodies from Chinese-default to English; updated the Chinese punctuation rule so it no longer applies to PR descriptions.
- Reworked `build-firmware.yml` to pass `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults`, enable `partitions.csv`, preserve the 8 MB image header, merge a flashable `FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin`, publish only that artifact, and use Actions cache v5.
- Integrated upstream PR #6 to resolve PR #4 conflicts: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, radio lifecycle, and low-power demos; a 3 MB factory partition; build/menu/configuration updates; hardware-guide coverage; and bilingual capability tables.
- Defined English imperative Conventional Commit formatting for both commits and PR titles.
- Removed stale sync-workflow template comments and generalized an irrelevant Redis TTL rule to cache components.
- Added Chinese punctuation, credential safety, and recoverable file-deletion conventions.
- Expanded source-comment requirements for functions, state, ownership, concurrency, timing, registers, and magic values.
- Removed AI execution instructions from product READMEs so they remain human-facing product and repository overviews.
- Added `docs/development/agent-guide.md` as the focused AI workflow guide.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, and the development index for the agent guide.
- Documented why the root README path is reserved for fork owners and how GitHub README precedence supports it.
- Created `main-update` from the upstream-aligned baseline and combined the repository-structure, firmware-CI, and upstream-sync work.
- Corrected the merged documentation index, workflow path, project tree, and CI references.
- Moved CI documentation from software design to `docs/development/`.
- Moved fork-only documentation assets from `assets/docs/` to `docs/assets/`.
- Moved the upstream English/Chinese project READMEs under `docs/` and renamed the documentation catalog to `docs/INDEX.md`.
- Initialized `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Standardized the initial project README language filenames.
- Added the `docs/`, `assets/`, and `skills/` directory structure.
- Moved the upstream hardware guide into `docs/hardware-design/`.
- Standardized subdirectory README capitalization and introduced fork conventions.
- Allowed fork-owned root README and supplemental documentation content on fork `main`.
- Added and documented the fork-only supplemental-document directory.
- Moved the build CI document to its dedicated CI branch before consolidation.
- Documented clean-`main` reasons, the direct-development exception, and Actions enablement for forks.
- Split the original agent rules into contribution, development, and fork documents with a compact root index.
- Updated software-design and project README references for the new documentation structure.
- Added the documentation catalog and task-triggered routing based on the earlier repository model.
- Added bilingual contribution, code-of-conduct, security, and support documents tailored to this ESP-IDF and fork workflow.
